# Project Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run this project, which showcases a personal profile/resume website.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

    If you have access to the project's repository (e.g., on GitHub), clone it to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Open the project directory:**

    Navigate to the directory containing the project files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, animations.css, images/favicon.ico).

3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**

    Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser. Alternatively, you can right-click the file and select "Open with" followed by your preferred browser.

    Or, you can open the file from your VSCode editor.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the website.
-   `styles.css`: The CSS file containing the styling rules for the website.
-   `animations.css`: The CSS file containing the animation styles for the website.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the interactive functionality of the website.
-   `images/favicon.ico`: The favicon (small icon) for the website.

## Additional Notes

-   The project uses a few external resources:
    -   Font Awesome icons (loaded from a CDN): Used for various icons throughout the website.
    -   Google Fonts (loaded from a CDN): Used for the "Poppins" font.
-   The `script.js` file includes basic form validation for the contact form. In a real-world application, you would typically send the form data to a server for processing.
-   The website is designed to be responsive and should adapt to different screen sizes.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the website by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can change the content, styling, and functionality to suit your needs.
